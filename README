The application can be run with

	$ java Main < input/pentogram.txt
	
Or, if you want to see the Eulerian circuit printed, add the verbose switch -v

	$ java Main -v < input/pentogram.txt

In place of 'pentogram.txt', you may use any of the test files provided
in the input/ directory, or any file consisting of a series of
connected vertices of the form

  a--b b--c c--a ..
  
The files in the input/ dir are:

	10000.txt
	1000.txt
	100.txt
	20000.txt
	40000.txt
	5000.txt
	input.txt
	pentogram.txt
	
The <number>.txt files are named after the amount of edges their graphs have.

----------------------------------------
I have included a test script that runs through the <number>.txt test
files. This can be run with

	$ ./test.sh
	
The test will take upwards of ten minutes to complete, depending on hardware.
The test runs the application against each test file and prints out the 
amount of time it takes to complete each time.
